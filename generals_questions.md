##TIPS:
* Don't panic.
	* Seriously.
		* STOP FUCKING PANICKING, YOU'RE GOING TO DO FINE.
* Sleep.
	* Get a regular sleep schedule with at least 7.5 hours of sleep each night, and stick to it at least a week in advance.
* Buy food/coffee for the 4-5 people that will be in the room for you. I spent ~$50 at Panera.
* DON'T PANIC.
