##TIPS:
* Dont panic.
	* Seriously.
		* STOP PANICKING, YOURE GOING TO DO FINE.
* Youve seen all of this stuff before. Even if you dont feel like you ever really 'learned' it, you know it better than you think that you do.
* Sleep.
	* Get a regular sleep schedule with at least 7.5 hours of sleep each night, and stick to it at least a week in advance.
* Buy food/coffee for the 4-5 people that will be in the room for you. I spent ~$50 at Panera.
* DONT PANIC.
* If things get really desperate, this recipe should help: 
	* 2 parts transcendental meditation
	* 3 parts Caffeine
	* 8 parts sobbing on the phone to your parents while they pretend to listen but are really watching reruns of Frasier
	* 100 ml of falling asleep in the shower
	* 2 teaspoons of having a nightmare while sleeping in the shower
	* 0.5 tablespoons of waking up from said nightmare, screaming, and scaring all of your neighbors
	* 1 cup of seriously considering becoming a non-violent version of Ted Kaczynski
	* Stir together until it congeals into a big, hot mess
	* Bake in the oven at 350 F for 20 minutes.
