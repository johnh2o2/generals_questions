These are all the questions I can remember....
John Hoffman (2015)

Jenny Greene -- extragalactic
=============================
* What is the Faber-Jackson relation? Tully-Fisher relation? Fundamental Plane? M-sigma relation?
* What is the evidence for dark matter?
* What is the winding problem?
* Questions about the details of the galactic rotation curve
	* Know the dependency of v_circ(r) for different density profiles
* What is the mass function/luminosity function for galaxies?
* What is the missing mass problem?
* How does the mass-to-light ratio depend upon the mass of the galaxy? What are the physical reasons behind this?
* Bottom heavy/top-heavy IMF

Eve -- Dynamics
===============
* Lots of questions about relaxation processes in the context globular clusters
	* Relaxation time
	* Are elliptical galaxies relaxed? Galaxy clusters? Globular clusters? etc.
* Obtaining the rotation curve of the galaxy
	* From, e.g. 21 cm?
	* Starlight?
* Question about how Shapley estimated the size of the milky way and our place within it
* How many globular clusters are there? Where do they reside? How old are they? What are their typical masses? Mass-to-light ratios?

Michael -- Stars
================
* Lots of questions about white dwarfs
	* How do they form?
	* What are their typical masses?
	* What is the chandrasekhar mass?
	* How are they supported against gravity?
	* What is their place on the HR diagram, how do they evolve on the HR diagram?
	* How do we measure masses/radii?
* What determines the minimum mass limit of the main sequence?
* Questions about measuring the age of stellar populations
* How do we probe the low-mass end of the IMF?
* Why do we care about the low-mass end of the IMF?
* What dominates the light of observed stellar populations? The mass?


Jim Stone -- ISM
================
* Phases of the ISM
* HII regions -- how big are they? What do they have to do with star formation?
* Why is it hard to measure H2? What can we use as a proxy?
* Jeans Mass
* What is alpha (A and B)?
* Radius of Str√∂mgren sphere?
* How is H2 formed in ISM?
* Questions about supernova remnants -- what are we seeing? What are the phases of evolution for a supernova remnant?
